.SH NAME
.BR tsocks 
\- Library for intercepting outgoing network connections and
redirecting them through a SOCKS server. 

.SH SYNOPSIS

Set LD_PRELOAD to load the library then use applications as normal

The syntax to force preload of the library for different shells is
specified below:
 
Bash, Ksh and Bourne shell -

export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libtsocks.so

C Shell - 

setenv LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libtsocks.so

.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR tsocks
is a library to allow transparent SOCKS proxying. It wraps the normal
connect() function. When a connection is attempted, it consults the 
configuration file (which is defined at configure time but defaults to 
/etc/tsocks.conf) and determines if the IP address specified is local. If 
it is not, the library redirects the connection to a SOCKS server
specified in the configuration file. It then negotiates that connection
with the SOCKS server and passes the connection back to the calling
program. 

.BR tsocks 
is designed for use in machines which are firewalled from then
internet. It avoids the need to recompile applications like lynx or
telnet so they can use SOCKS to reach the internet. It behaves much like
the SOCKSified TCP/IP stacks seen on other platforms.

.SS ARGUMENTS
Most arguments to
.BR tsocks
are provided in the configuration file (the location of which is defined
at configure time by the --with-conf=<file> argument but defaults to
/etc/tsocks.conf). The structure of this file is documented in tsocks.conf(8)

Some configuration parameters defined in the configuration file can be 
overriden by environment variables as follows:

.TP
.I TSOCKS_NODEBUG
When this environment variable is set tsocks issues absolutely no error
or debugging messages. This is only needed if tsocks output interferes with
a program it is embedded in. The same effect can be achieved more 
permanently by specifying the --disable-debug option to ./configure at 
build time

.TP
.I TSOCKS_NODEBUG
When this environment variable is set tsocks issues absolutely no error
or debugging messages. 

.TP
.I TSOCKS_USERNAME
This environment variable can be used to specify the username to be used when
version 5 SOCKS servers request username/password authentication. This 
overrides the default username that can be specified in the configuration
file using 'default_user', see tsocks.conf(8) for more information. This 
variable is ignored for version 4 SOCKS servers.

.TP
.I TSOCKS_PASSWORD
This environment variable can be used to specify the password to be used when 
version 5 SOCKS servers request username/password authentication. This 
overrides the default password that can be specified in the configuration 
file using 'default_pass', see tsocks.conf(8) for more information. This 
variable is ignored for version 4 SOCKS servers.
 
.SS DNS ISSUES
.BR tsocks
will normally not be able to send DNS queries through a SOCKS server since
SOCKS V4 works on TCP and DNS normally uses UDP. Version 1.5 and up do
however provide a method to force DNS lookups to use TCP, which then makes
them proxyable. This option can only enabled at compile time, please
consult the INSTALL file for more information.

.SS ERRORS
.BR tsocks
will generate error messages and print them to stderr when there are
problems with the configuration file or the SOCKS negotiation with the
server if the DEBUG variable is set at compile time. The DEBUG variable is
set by default but may cause problems with some programs that redirect
stderr.

.SS CAVEATS
.BR tsocks
will not in the above configuration be able to provide SOCKS proxying to
setuid applications or applications that are not run from a shell. You can
force all applications to LD_PRELOAD the library by placing the path to
libtsocks in /etc/ld.so.preload. Please make sure you correctly enter the
full path to the library in this file if you do this. If you get it wrong,
you will be UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING with the machine and will have to boot
it with a rescue disk and remove the file (or try the saveme program, see
the INSTALL file for more info).  THIS IS A ***WARNING***, please be
careful. Also be sure the library is in the root filesystem as all hell
will break loose if the directory it is in is not available at boot time.

.SH BUGS

.BR tsocks
can only perform outgoing TCP connections

.BR tsocks
is NOT fully RFC compliant in its implementation of version 5 of SOCKS, it
only supports the 'username and password' or 'no authentication'
authentication methods. The RFC specifies GSSAPI must be supported by any
compliant implementation. I haven't done this, anyone want to help?

.BR tsocks
can force the libc resolver to use TCP for name queries, if it does this
it does it regardless of whether or not the DNS to be queried is local or
not. This introduces overhead and should only be used when needed.

.BR tsocks 
uses the ELF shared library mechanism to intercept
system calls.  As a result, it cannot trace the actions of statically
linked executables, non-ELF executables, or executables that make system
calls directly with the system call trap or through the syscall() routine.
